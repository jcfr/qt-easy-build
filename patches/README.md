# Qt Patches

Fixes and improvements to Qt that should first be contributed upstream. The [Qt Contribution Guidelines](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Contribution_Guidelines) is a great resource to guide you through the process.

Each patch is documented by adding an entry below. Whenever possible, references to bugs.python.org https://bugreports.qt.io/, corresponding GitHub PRs and any related discussions on forums or mailing lists are also provided.

Before being applied, patches are sorted alphabetically. This ensures that patch starting with 0001- is applied before the one starting with 0002-.
